This is a follow along exercise of docker class from www.pluralsight.com. The name of this class is "Integrating Docker with DevOps Automation Workflow"

The sample application that i am using for this class has been downloaded from the course material. The automation workflow makes use of following softwares in sequence:

- sample_app development on local computer
- pushed to github repo
- builds code using circleci
- builds docker image using tutum
- pushes docker image on to docker hub
- containerizing docker image to run in aws

Feel free to contact me at rutul-patel@live.com if you have any queries or suggestions. Thanks!
